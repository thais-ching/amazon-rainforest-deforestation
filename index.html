              <h1>About this project</h1>
              <p>The Amazon Rainforest has faced significant changes due to deforestation and climate change. This website provides an interactive view of how these effects have unfolded over the years.</p>
              <p>Discover the effects of deforestation on the Amazon Rainforest over the years. The Amazon Rainforest, commonly called the "Lungs of the Earth," is an immense tropical forest teeming with life and ecological significance, stretching across much of South America. Renowned for its extraordinary biodiversity, it serves as a cornerstone of the planet's ecological balance.</p>
              <p>Flowing for nearly 4,000 miles through several countries, the Amazon River acts as the rainforest's lifeline. Its vast basin has created a singular environment that continues to fascinate and inspire people worldwide.</p>
